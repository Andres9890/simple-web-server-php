# Simple Web Server

A super simple web server app for Windows and macOS, built using Electron and [send](https://www.npmjs.com/package/send).

Inspired by [Web Server for Chrome](https://github.com/kzahel/web-server-chrome), which is going away.

Features:
- Run multiple web servers at the same time
- Supports Single Page Applications
- You can keep it running in the background
