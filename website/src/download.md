# Download

Simple Web Server is available for Windows and macOS. 

You can also [manually build](/docs/build.md) and install the app. We don't offer a Linux download yet, so Linux users should manually build for their platform.

Simple Web Server is not supported on Chrome OS. Chrome OS users should use [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) for as long as Chrome Apps continue to work on the platform.
